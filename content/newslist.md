**[Jul 27, 2022]** We (speaker: [Prof. Ju Sun](https://sunju.org/)) introduced **NCVX PyGRANSO** and its practical applications and tricks in the *Nonsmooth Optimization in Machine Learning session* in the [**International Conference on Continuous Optimization (ICCOPT), 2022**](https://iccopt2022.lehigh.edu/). See the [talk slides](/ICCOPT22-NCVX.pdf) for more details!

**[Jul 26, 2022]** [*NCVX*](https://github.com/sun-umn/NCVX) [*PyGRANSO*](https://github.com/sun-umn/PyGRANSO) v1.2.0 released. Check our [Change Log](https://github.com/sun-umn/PyGRANSO/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) here!

**[May 29, 2022]** I am funded by the [FAIR4HEP Grant](https://fair4hep.github.io/) to make FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) AI models for high-energy physics data.

**[Feb 20, 2022]** [*NCVX*](https://github.com/sun-umn/NCVX) [*PyGRANSO*](https://github.com/sun-umn/PyGRANSO) v1.1.0 released. Join our [NCVX PyGRANSO Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/umn.edu/g/ncvx) for more information!

**[Jan 07, 2022]** Our NCVX package is highlighted in [Research Computing (Office of the Vice President for Research)](https://rc.umn.edu/project/building-numerical-optimization-software) 

**[Jan 01, 2022]** [NCVX](https://github.com/sun-umn/NCVX) with its initial solver *PyGRANSO* v1.0.0 released. Check the [documentation page](https://ncvx.org/) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sun-umn/NCVX) for more information.

**[Nov 29, 2021]** Proud to release our paper [NCVX: A User-Friendly and Scalable Package for Nonconvex Optimization in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13984) on arXiv! [NCVX](https://ncvx.org/) is the initial translation and revamping of the [GRANSO package](http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/), with convenient features such as auto-differentiation and GPU support. In particular, NCVX can be used to solve constrained deep learning problems.

**[May 25, 2021]** I am funded by the [U of M Informatics Institute (UMII) Seed Grant Program](https://research.umn.edu/units/umii) to revamp the [GRANSO](http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/) package into a user-friendly, scalable numerical optimization package.
