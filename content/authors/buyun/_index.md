I am a M.S. student in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), also work as a graduate research assistant in [Prof. Ju Sun](https://sunju.org/)'s group.

Broadly, my research is about **deep learning**, **optimization**, and **robustness**. Specifically, I am interested in: 1). **User-friendly and scalable software for constrained optimization in deep learning**; 2). **Robustness issue in computer vision**; 3). **Deep learning with non-trivial constraints**.

Prior to this, I obtained my first M.S. degree in [Materials Science](https://cse.umn.edu/cems) at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), and my B.S. degree from the [School of Physics](https://physics.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp).
Before joining [Prof. Ju Sun](https://sunju.org/)'s group, I worked as a research assistant in [Prof. J. Ilja Siepmann](https://siepmann.chem.umn.edu/)'s computational chemistry group.
