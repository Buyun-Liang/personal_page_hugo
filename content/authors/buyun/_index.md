TODO 
I am a M.S. student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, also work as a graduate research assistant in Prof. Ju Sun's group.
Broadly, my research is about optimization in machine/deep learning and machine/deep learning in vision. Specifically, I am interested in: User-friendly and scalable software for nonconvex optimization in machine/deep learning. Deep Learning with deterministic and stochastic constraints. Learning in distributed and collaborative environments.
Prior to this, I obtained my first M.S. degree in Materials Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and my B.S. degree from the School of Physics, Nanjing University.
Before joining Prof. Ju Sun's group, I worked as a research assistant in Prof. J. Ilja Siepmann's computational chemistry group.
